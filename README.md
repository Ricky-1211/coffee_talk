# ☕ Brew Heaven - Coffee Shop Application

## Project Overview

**Project URL**: [Coffee Shop App](https://lovable.dev/projects/a2c00049-2c9a-4824-891f-aecb86e629b9)

A production-ready, responsive web application for coffee shop management, featuring secure authentication, inventory management, product catalog with advanced filtering, and a comprehensive admin interface.

## Architecture & Technical Stack

### Frontend
- **Build System**: Vite 5.x (optimized bundling with module federation)
- **Language**: TypeScript 5.3+ (strict mode enabled)
- **UI Framework**: React 18.x (with Server Components)
- **Component System**: shadcn-ui (headless components with Radix UI primitives)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.x (with custom theming and design tokens)
- **State Management**: Context API + React Query 5.x (with query invalidation strategies)
- **Routing**: React Router 6.x (with lazy loading and code splitting)
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form + Zod validation
- **Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library + Playwright for E2E

### Performance Optimizations
- Code splitting and lazy loading
- Image optimization with modern formats (WebP/AVIF)
- Memoization patterns for expensive renders
- Progressive enhancement strategy

## Development Setup

### 🛠️ Prerequisites
- Node.js ≥ 18.x LTS
- npm ≥ 9.x or equivalent package manager
- Git ≥ 2.40.x

### Development Workflow Options

#### 1. Lovable AI Platform (Recommended)
```bash
# No local setup required
# Visit the project URL directly
https://lovable.dev/projects/a2c00049-2c9a-4824-891f-aecb86e629b9
```
All changes via Lovable are automatically committed with conventional commit messages.

#### 2. Local Development Environment
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <REPOSITORY_URL>

# Navigate to project
cd brew-heaven

# Install dependencies with frozen lockfile for consistency
npm ci

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

#### 3. GitHub Integration Options
- **Direct Editing**: Use GitHub's editor for quick changes
- **Codespaces**: Launch a pre-configured development environment in the browser
- **Pull Requests**: Follow the branching strategy (feature/fix/refactor prefixes)

VITE_REFRESH_TOKEN_NAME=refresh_token

# Feature Flags
VITE_ENABLE_ANALYTICS=true
VITE_ENABLE_NEWSLETTER=true
```

## CI/CD Pipeline
This project implements a comprehensive CI/CD workflow:

1. **Continuous Integration**:
   - Linting and type checking
   - Unit and integration tests
   - Code coverage reports
   - Bundle size analysis

2. **Continuous Deployment**:
   - Automatic deployment to staging on PR merge to `develop`
   - Manual promotion to production from `main` branch
   - Canary deployments for major features

## Deployment

### Quick Deployment
1. Navigate to [Lovable Project](https://lovable.dev/projects/a2c00049-2c9a-4824-891f-aecb86e629b9)
2. Click Share → Publish
3. Monitor deployment status in the project dashboard

### Custom Domain Setup
1. Navigate to Project > Settings > Domains
2. Click "Connect Domain"
3. Configure DNS records (A record or CNAME)
4. Set up SSL certificate (automatic with Let's Encrypt)

## Performance Monitoring & Analytics
- Lighthouse CI for performance regression testing
- Error tracking with source maps
- User behavior analytics (optional, privacy-focused)

## Contributing

### Branching Strategy
- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch for features
- `feature/*`: New features
- `fix/*`: Bug fixes
- `refactor/*`: Code improvements

### Pull Request Process
1. Create a branch from `develop`
2. Implement changes with tests
3. Submit PR with conventional commit messages
4. Pass CI checks and code review
5. Squash and merge to `develop`

### Code Standards
- Follow project ESLint configuration
- Maintain 90%+ test coverage for business logic
- Use TypeScript strictly (no `any` types)
- Document complex logic with JSDoc

## Troubleshooting
- **CORS Issues**: Ensure API URLs are correctly configured
- **Build Failures**: Check Node.js and npm versions
- **Performance Issues**: Run Lighthouse audits for insights
- **State Management Problems**: Enable React DevTools
